madpad-node
===========

Create an editable pad that can be accessed easily from any computer.

This is similar to [Madpad](https://github.com/sifxtreme/madpad) but this time written with Node / Express instead of Rails.

Go to [madpad.me](http://madpad.me) to try it out

This uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to synchronize the textarea in real time.
